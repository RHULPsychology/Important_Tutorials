# Agenda: 
  - To convert raw DICOM data coming out of the scanner into usable and sharable BIDS format
  - Learn the basics of how to parallelize processing on the cluster
  
# Reading and Documentation:

  - What is DICOM?

# Essential exercises:

  - Git usage on the cluster
  
You should use the following command to update git. You should be able to fork a repository from github or create a new repo, clone it on the cluster, make changes, git add, git commit and git pull and git push fro the command line. It is very important for any further steps. Please consult the tutorials mentioned in https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/Git/Important_Links.md
  
  ```bash
      source /usr/local/apps/psycapps/config/conda_bash_update
  ```
