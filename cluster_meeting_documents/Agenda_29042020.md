# Agenda: 
  - To convert raw DICOM data coming out of the scanner into usable and sharable BIDS format
  - Learn the basics of how to parallelize processing on the cluster
  
# Reading and Documentation:

  - What is DICOM?
  
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM
  
  
  - What is BIDS and why is it important?
  
  https://bids.neuroimaging.io/
  
  https://sarenseeley.github.io/BIDS-fmriprep-MRIQC.html#why_bids
  
  
  - What is HeuDiConv?

  https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# Essential exercises:

  - Familiarization with the cluster architecture
  
You should familiarize yourself with the custer architecture image that is shared in https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/README.md. You should be able to relate to terms like a login node, a master node and worker nodes. This would be very essential to understand how the parallelization would work.  

  - Git usage on the cluster
  
You should use the following command to update git. You should be able to fork a repository from github or create a new repo, clone it on the cluster, make changes, git add, git commit and git pull and git push fro the command line. It is very important for any further steps. Please consult the tutorials mentioned in https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/Git/Important_Links.md
  
  ```bash
      source /usr/local/apps/psycapps/config/conda_bash_update
  ```
  
  - Heudiconv on cluster
  
This section will be done as a practical during the meeting. It would help if you could familiarize yourself with the heudiconv scripts that we will use on the cluster. It is available at https://github.com/RHULPsychology/HeudiConv_BIDS_conversion
  
  

# Non-Essential but recommended exercises: 

  - Install linux subsystem on windows 10.
  
  Please follow the instructions mentioned in https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/Windows_Prep_for_Cluster/Linux_Subsystem_Activation.md on your windows system
  
  - Install FSL on linux subsystem
  
 Please follow the instructions mentioned in https://github.com/RHULPsychology/Important_Tutorials/blob/master/fslinstallation_on_windows/instructions.md on your windows system
