# Understanding the folder structure

- The archive space is located at /MRIArchive. It' folder structure has been organized similarly to the /MRIWork space.

For example:

The data in folder ```bash /MRIWork/MRIWork10/pv/giusi_pollicina/Old/``` should be compressed and archived in ```bash /MRIArchive/MRIWork10/pv/giusi_pollicina/Old.tar.gz``` location as a compressed tarball gzip file. Individuals will have writing permissions to their respective archive folders.



# Compress the data and archive it

# delete the original folder

# Uncompress if needed

# delete the uncompressed folder
